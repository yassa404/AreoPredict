# 🌍 AreoPredict

**AreoPredict** is an AI-powered tool that predicts air pollution and weather risks using data from **NASA satellites** and real-time weather models.  
Built by **Team Elysians** for **NASA Space Apps Cairo** 🚀

---

## 🎯 Overview
AreoPredict helps users visualize and forecast air quality levels by simply entering a **location name**.  
The system automatically gathers all related environmental data — such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant levels — to generate predictions and forecasts.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters a location (city or region).  
2. The system fetches real-time NASA and weather data.  
3. AI models analyze patterns to **predict air pollution** before it happens.  
4. If a dangerous condition is detected, an **alert** is generated and displayed.
